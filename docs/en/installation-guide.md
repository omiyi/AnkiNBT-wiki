## Verifying Installation

After launching the game:

1. Open the **Mods** menu (NeoForge or Fabric) and look for **AnkiNBT** in the mod list.
2. In-game, hold any item and press `N` — the editor should open.
3. If nothing happens, check that:
   - You have the correct mod version for your Minecraft version.
   - On Fabric, Fabric API is also installed.
   - You are using Java 21 for Minecraft 1.21, or Java 25 for Minecraft 26.x.

## Updating

To update AnkiNBT, simply replace the old JAR in `.minecraft/mods/` with the new one. Your configuration file (`ankinbt.json`) will be preserved.
